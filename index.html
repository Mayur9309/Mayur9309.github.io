		<p>Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and can even be harnessed in cloudy weather. 
			The rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the Earth is about 10,000 times greater than the rate 
			at which humankind consumes energy. Solar technologies can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, 
			electricity, and fuels for a host of applications. Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical 
			energy either through photovoltaic panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation.
			Although not all countries are equally endowed with solar energy, a significant contribution to the energy 
			mix from direct solar energy is possible for every country. The cost of manufacturing solar panels has 
			plummeted dramatically in the last decade, making them not only affordable but often the cheapest form of 
			electricity. Solar panels have a lifespan of roughly 30 years, and come in variety of shades depending on 
			the type of material used in manufacturing. National Institute of Solar Energy has assessed the Country’s 
			solar potential of about 748 GW assuming 3% of the waste land area to be covered by Solar PV modules. Solar 
			energy has taken a central place in India's National Action Plan on Climate Change with National Solar Mission 
			as one of the key Missions.  National Solar Mission (NSM) was launched on 11th January, 2010. NSM is a major 
			initiative of the Government of India with active participation from States to promote ecological sustainable 
			growth while addressing India’s energy security challenges. It will also constitute a major contribution by 
			India to the global effort to meet the challenges of climate change. The Mission’s objective is to establish 
			India as a global leader in solar energy by creating the policy conditions for solar technology diffusion 
			across the country as quickly as possible. The Mission targets installing 100 GW grid-connected solar power 
			plants by the year 2022. This is line with India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions(INDCs) target 
			to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy 
			resources and to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent from 2005 level by 2030.</p>

			<p>Off-grid Solar PV Applications Programme is one of the oldest programmes of the Ministry aimed at providing
				solar PV based applications in areas where grid power is either not available or is unreliable. Applications 
				such as solar home lighting systems, solar street lighting systems, solar power plants, solar pumps, solar 
				lanterns and solar study lamps are covered under the programme.</p>

				<h1>GRID CONNECTED</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="solar_ongrid_big.jpg" alt="" class="image image-full" />
			<p>Solar power sector in India has emerged as a fast upcoming section in last few years. It supports the government 
				agenda of sustainable growth, while, emerging as an integral part of the solution to meet the nation’s energy
				needs and an essential player for energy security.<br>A target of installing 100 GW of grid connected solar 
				power by 2022 has been kept. In order to achieve the above target, Government of India have launched various 
				schemes to encourage generation of solar power in the country like Solar Park Scheme, VGF Schemes, CPSU Scheme, 
				Defence Scheme, Canal bank & Canal top Scheme, Bundling Scheme, Grid Connected Solar Rooftop Scheme etc.  
				Various policy measures are also undertaken to promote the grid connected solar power plants.</p>

				<h3>Monocrystalline solar panels</h3>
				<p>The monocrystalline solar panels are also known as the single crystal panels. They are made from pure silicon 
					crystal which is sliced into several wafers forming cells. These wafers are cut to an octagonal shaped wafer 
					because of which they get their unique look and uniform colour. They can be easily identified by their black 
					or dark blue colour, as they are made from pure silicon</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="column2">
			<div class="box"> <a href="#"><img src="polycry.png" alt="" class="image image-full" /></a>
				<h3>Polycrystalline solar panels</h3>
				<p>The polycrystalline solar panels are composed of multiple silicon crystals. They are made from silicon fragments 
					that are melted and poured into square molds. Once these crystals are cooled, they are sliced into thin wafers 
					and assembled together to form a polycrystalline solar panel. They are also known as “multi-crystalline” panels.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="column3">
			<div class="box"> <a href="#"><img src="PERC.png" alt="" class="image image-full"  height="190" /></a>
				<h3>Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact cells (PERC) solar panels</h3>
				<p>Also known as ‘rear cells’, PERC solar panels are manufactured using advanced technology. It is done by adding 
					a layer on the back of solar cells. The traditional solar panels absorb sunlight only to some extent and some 
					light passes straight through them. The additional layer in the PERC panels allows this unabsorbed sunlight 
					to be absorbed again from the rear side of the panels, making it even more efficient.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="column4">
			<div class="box"> <a href="#"><img src="thin_film.png" alt="" class="image image-full"  height="190"/></a>
				<h3>Thin-film solar panels</h3>
				<p>Unlike monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels, thin-film solar panels are manufactured using 
					photovoltaic substances which include Amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) 
					and cadmium telluride (CdTe). These substances are deposited onto a solid surface such as glass, metal 
					or plastic making it lighter and easy to install.</p>
